link,Voters will be asked ‘Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union? when they go to the polls for the in/out referendum  it has been confirmed.  In response UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said:  It is a simple straightforward  unambiguous question. That much is clear.   However that Cameron is opting to give the pro-EU side the positive  Yes  suggests strongly that his negotiations are so much fudge.

Grassroots football in some of the world’s poorest countries and fans everywhere are the apparent victims of these crimes.  “Only a root and branch clear out at FIFA will satisfy them that we’re cleaning up the game once and for all.”,2015-05-28T10:51:03+0000,2439,240

link,UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has today reiterated his position on the problems caused by health tourism to the NHS.   Though many in the Westminster bubble were outraged by my comments about the impact of Health Tourism  and appalled that I mentioned those with HIV as part of that problem  what was clear was that the general public did not share that outrage.   Immediately after the debate YouGov carried out a poll that showed that a full 50% of the population agreed with me  with only 34% opposed. I also received very moving messages of support from UK sufferers of HIV who have found it increasingly hard to receive the treatment they need because of pressure on clinics.  “There is obviously some misunderstanding as to UKIP’s position on this. We believe firmly in the NHS. Not the International Health Service. We believe that anybody moving to this country should be in possession of health insurance which covers them for forthcoming health care. If they have that insurance  then they will not have the detrimental impact on NHS budgets and services that mean that at times UK citizens find it difficult to access that which they and their families have built up over the generations. Most countries in the world  such as the US and Australia  have a similar policy and they are not regarded as in any way selfish  merely sensible. ,2015-06-01T12:23:00+0000,5271,743

This was obvious from their sheer lack of commitment to meet the NATO spending target of 2% of GDP on defence.”   “The simple fact is that Britain’s armed forces are already starved of much needed resources and further cuts would seriously hamper the UK’s ability to respond to the constantly evolving world security situation.

I share his obviously deep sense of frustration at discovering that our Foreign Office regarded his job as little more than ceremonial. He is a man who has taken his responsibility to the Rock and its people with the utmost seriousness.   As Governor he represents Her Majesty the Queen directly and not the British government and his role is to be responsible for external affairs  internal security and defence. It is not a job that can be second guessed by a Foreign office bureaucrat. Nor indeed a Government that seems to be more concerned about pandering to Spain. It is doing this as part of its tactical manoeuvring to obtain European Union reform than it is to standing up for the interests and safety of Gibraltar.   The Military importance of Gibraltar is higher now than it has been in decades  with the growth of Islamist terrorism in the Maghreb and the current migration crisis in the Mediterranean.

The problem is  if we continue to be members of the EU and as a consequence  signed up to the ECHR  I have little doubt  votes for prisoners  will be forced upon us.   If the ECHR does force the UK to give votes to prisoners it will be a huge slap in the face to the British democratic process and once again signals the UK cannot escape this ECHR supremacy while we are signed-up members of the EU. ,2015-06-02T14:02:00+0000,2810,616

Andrew Charalambous  the UKIP housing spokesman said   On one hand the EU is pressing for greater energy efficiency on the other it is making the cost of energy efficiency much greater.   The real loser is the British tenant  because in reality this added cost will translate into higher rents. You cannot apply uniformity across countries who do not enjoy uniform circumstances.

Yet without bold commitments to scrap EU contributions  the HS2 vanity project and significantly reducing foreign aid  this government simply is not restoring fiscal responsibility to the country at a rate that we find acceptable.  Deficit reduction is still too slow. The deficit will still be running at £70bn this year  a rate that is still far too high  and means we will not get into surplus until 2019 or 2020.  We strongly oppose scrapping the student maintenance grant and replacing it with a loan. Once again this shows a typical Tory adherence to the class system that simply fails to recognise why young people from low income backgrounds need financial support in order to compete.

Unemployment is reduced not by health and safety regulations or expensive compliance rules but by people starting up and expanding businesses and taking on employees.   For that to happen they need to know they have flexible employment laws  open markets and solid economies with steady demand.   In contrast to this  the EU enforces rules making it expensive for SMEs to take on staff and environmental legislation that pushes up the costs of production.   As we start the campaign for Britain to leave the EU and regain its place on the world stage these statistics are vital for quashing the idea that we need political union for jobs. ,2015-07-17T05:15:00+0000,1604,185

It has also led to a situation in which effectively no questioning of other cultures  religions or traditions has been allowed.   We must also make it clear that immigration on the scale it has been happening is the enemy of true integration. It is simply practically impossible to integrate such numbers. And for those coming to our country  there is little incentive or need to integrate in a situation where there are effectively ready-made communities. A sense of separateness is then further entrenched.   While we remain in the EU  we cannot control our borders. We must once again take control of our own destiny; only then can there be any hope of building a more integrated society  one which is once again united. ,2015-07-20T13:05:18+0000,5187,1349

This government pretends it believes in the fundamental building block of society  the family  yet oversees a system that deliberately pulls families apart.

photo,UKIP MEP Mike Hookem slams the government s inability to control the migration crisis.  He said:  After spending many hours in Dunkirk police station reporting the events of Monday  where my staff and I were threatened with a handgun  the National Police told us there was nothing they could do unless they had proof the cars were involved in smuggling  and often they didn t have the ability  even if they did manage to bug suspect cars  to translate what the men were saying within the 48 hour time period the law allows.  It means it is up to the British authorities to take action  checking cars when they enter the UK and not just waving through these smart Passats and Jaguars because they have British number plates.   The severity of the situation is hidden from the majority of the British public. After days spent with lorry drivers  French police and residents of these areas I know they are being threatened and intimidated. Crime is up  people do not dare to enter areas the smugglers control and at night Calais and other towns report migrants threatening residents and businesses.    We ve the EU to thank for this mess we are in and a government who have simply refused to step up to their obligations to protect the British people. Far from having ‘a grip’ on the problem  this lacklustre response by the government to deport illegal immigrants  clamp down on these suspected British people traffickers and to tell the EU that we will not be taking part in rescue missions in the Mediterranean only maintains the problem.

However  Mark expressed concern at policy makers dragging their feet on returning interest rates to more normal levels.  Prices tend to fall in July with the summer sales  but this year the fall in the CPI index from 128.2 to 128.0 was less than the fall from 128.3 to 127.8 between June and July last year.

There seems to be a distance from what I describe as the Cardiff Bay establishment and just people I speak to on the doorstep in Wales   said Mr Reckless.   They re out of touch with voters. And I think part of that is the Cardiff Bay establishment sees devolution as something that s about them and about their powers and their importance.   Mr Reckless said UKIP accepted devolution and wanted to  make it work   but rejected the idea of Welsh powers over income tax without public approval in a referendum.   We don t want to see taxes raised and I don t think there s any burning desire from people in Wales to be paying yet more tax than people in England   he said.   I don t understand why there s such a consensus in the Cardiff Bay establishment that that s the way to go  having promised that that wouldn t happen back in 2011   he added  referring to the last devolution referendum in Wales.  ---  Living in Wales?

This latest declaration is yet another of example of this. Over the summer lorry drivers and passengers suffered the consequences of the British and French government’s inability to develop cohesive long term solutions.  The UK government has finally woken up to the logistics and security threat that migrant flash mobs in the Port pose to a major transport artery to and from Britain. The French Authorities  as usual don t care about the British problem  are prioritising receiving EU money for rebuilding Calais port over the migrant camps. Neither government has the political will  ideas or care to address the cause of the problem in this declaration which is the extraordinary flow of illegal migrants into Europe. ,2015-08-20T09:04:23+0000,2931,1022

It’s an idea dreamed up the Conservative Party’s PR department to camouflage Thursday’s ONS immigration statistics which will show that yet gain the government has lost control of Britain’s borders.  “Sending illegally working immigrants to gaol will cost a fortune  put huge pressure on the prison system  add treacle to the already gummed up courts system with the possibility of remand and appeals stretching into a Human Rights Act horizon and keep the immigrants on our shores. Instead the Government should deport them. If they are illegally working they have broken the law. It’s that simple. ,2015-08-25T13:54:02+0000,2662,670

With hopeless energy policy driving up operational costs to unmanageable levels  massive companies like Tata are closing plants in Wales in favour of cheaper sites elsewhere. The real impact on the Welsh economy must not be underestimated.  “Currently we take directions from the European Union on ridiculous targets that render our economy deeply uncompetitive. It’s all very well MPs in Westminster and AMs in Cardiff Bay decrying this latest closure  but until they admit that unless we wrest back control of energy policy from the EU and pursue an effective  business friendly agenda rather than pie-in-the-sky green legislation  this sort of story will become all too common. ,2015-08-26T16:36:51+0000,1688,470

It is important that neither those in Governmental nor in the civil service exploit their office in order to promote one side of the argument or the other. The Government is duty bound to give absolute clarity as to what the ‘exceptions’ to Purdah are.   We would also call for the Government to make it clear to the European Union institutions that they too should refrain from announcing new policy objectives and spending promises in the UK during the period of the campaign and also honour British purdah rules.   This is the first time in over forty years that UK citizens will be granted a say on our ongoing relationship with the European Union.

link,UKIP Leader Nigel Farage for Breitbart London:  It is a paradox with the modern EU that the more each of its grand designs such as the Euro and the current migrant crisis fail  the greater is the ability of Brussels to gain more powers and more centralisation.    In nearly every case  from Tsipras’ election victory in Greece to the current crisis  nothing stops the juggernaut. Every objection is overruled. The European Council meets again next week. One day  this whole thing will blow apart though I suspect not just yet. For now  Mr. Juncker can enjoy his fine lunches.   LIKE if you agree with Nigel.,2015-09-18T16:15:00+0000,3456,492

To people like him  there isn t a problem there isn t a crisis  there isn t a question to which the answer is not “More European Union”.   Harmonisation of tax regimes will only have the impact of making European Countries less competitive in the global market and drive business our of the European Union  and therefore out of the UK into the wider world. Harmonisation has failed  is failing and will continue to fail in almost every area it has been tried  and to try to impose it on corporation tax will just be another example.   Why should British business suffer reduced competitiveness  and the UK Government be hamstrung in the Global market in order to spare the legal blushes of a posturing Eurocrat?”,2015-09-18T18:20:00+0000,1582,247

They want decent housing  employment  a good education for their children and a sense of being heard and represented. Instead they see out of touch politicians in the Assembly who are totally disconnected from their world.  “Finally next year that will come to an end  with UKIP representatives in the Assembly.  This is not just an exciting time for UKIP. This is an exciting time for Wales and I expect UKIP to be the major story of next year’s assembly election campaign. ,2015-09-19T10:20:00+0000,3854,590

As long as we remain members of the European Union  Britain is simply not allowed to do this   says the West Midlands MEP  who sits on the Transport committee in Brussels.  Ever since the first Railways Directive back in 1998  the EU has dictated that all member states must provide competition and allow independent companies to apply for non-discriminatory track access.   Mr Corbyn has only been in position for a week  but it is already clear that his policy ideas are off the rails.

Currently 80% of decisions are being made in Brussels and Frankfurt and not Holyrood and Westminster. UKIP is the ONLY party giving real independence to Scotland by bringing powers back to Holyrood and Westminster from the undemocratic remote European Union.

In the UK we know that politicians are out of sync with what the public want to happen about the migrant crisis and EU leaders are no different. The EU already have their Common Asylum and Immigration policy ready to go for next year and as we head into this referendum campaign we should keep this in the forefront of our mind in deciding whether we want to control who comes to live in our own country.   The best policy would be to help genuine refugees in the camps in Lebanon  Jordan and Turkey  ending the demand for the people traffickers and stopping deaths at sea. ,2015-09-22T17:05:30+0000,3814,1054

Not only will these 1 700 jobs now be lost with all the uncertainty that redundancy creates  there will be a secondary impact on many other local companies associated with the steel industry. Redcar already has a high level of unemployment  so the impact upon the local community cannot be overestimated.

This goes to show that being ruled by the EU and their  green  policies not only destroys businesses but destroys people s lives in this country by taking away their livelihood.

It is the language of condescension and contempt and it should have no part in political debate.  “The attitude portrayed by these comments shows a deep seated contempt for voters  and it shows what is wrong with so many of today’s political parties  whose only interest in voters is to use and exploit them.

While both The Prime Minister and Theresa May echo UKIP almost verbatim in their rhetoric  it is important to bear in mind that this is the second term under the Conservatives  with May as Home Secretary and Cameron as leader and their government has broken all previous records on net migration and asylum into the UK.    Until the government grasp the nettle and opts Britain out of free movement or leaves the EU entirely  it can only talk about controlling our borders not actually do it. Similarly just sounding like UKIP doesn t mean that they have the well thought through fair and ethical migration policies that our party won so much support for at the last general election.

To howls of derision  I told the European Parliament that what we have now on the continent is not a refugee crisis  as the media continues to tell us  but an economic migrant one.   In my opinion  we need to be honest about the problem we are facing and call it what it is. Now is not the time for politically correct language. The liberal Left  in their desire to please all of the people all of the time  are helping no one and solving nothing. These are issues that need addressing head on. ,2015-10-10T14:53:10+0000,4582,769

He argued that we are stronger in the world  have more influence and more clout. Has he forgotten that the United Kingdom no longer even has a seat on the World Trade Organisation and that Brussels now wants a single EU seat on the UN Security Council?   He argues that in order to trade we have to have free movement of people. Nowhere else in the world is that the case. To think that UK manufactured cars would face tariffs when we import hundreds of thousands more cars from Germany shows utter detachment from the realities of trade.   To argue that his is the patriotic position is turning the truth on its head. The EU has a star spangled banner. He s welcome to it. I prefer the Union Flag. ,2015-10-12T11:38:08+0000,3952,1106

link,Ahead of senior BBC executives  including Lord Hall  Director General and James Harding  Director of News and Current Affairs  appearing in front of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has written an open letter to the BBC Trust and Ofcom to ensure that the debate surrounding the forthcoming EU referendum is framed accurately.  Too often in recent months it has become normal for many political correspondents from the BBC and elsewhere to use to use  Europe  as shorthand for  the European Union . Equally  it has been widely reported that those campaigning to remain in the European Union are deliberately replacing the name of the organisation with the term  Europe . To do so is inaccurate  given what Eurosceptics oppose is membership of a supranational political organisation  not fellow continental European nation states.  The EU Referendum debate is therefore not about whether Britain should remain in Europe  a geographic reality  but the European Union  a political construction. Furthermore  the Electoral Commission has suggested that the question be  Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?’. As such  and as Nigel Farage s letter makes clear  reporting by the BBC and other broadcasters should reflect this deliberate selection of words.

Sadly  because we are members of the EU  we must go cap in hand to the European Commissioner on Trade  in a lengthy process necessitating the agreement of 27 other EU states  “Thousands of jobs have been lost in the last week at steel plants throughout the UK because of two main factors; the dumping of Chinese steel and a British steel industry rendered uncompetitive because of exorbitant energy prices  a consequence of the EU’s obsession with carbon emissions.   Our current membership of the EU is helping cripple our steel industry by pushing up energy prices and stopping us acting immediately at WTO level.

It’s this pledge that we’re fulfilling with the launch of Opening Up the Family Courts  the first paper to be published by the UKIP Parliamentary Resource Unit.  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell said “There is a scandal at the moment. Secrecy within the UK’s system of family courts is allowing social workers to ride roughshod over ordinary people and resulting in the unnecessary breakup of families and forced adoptions.  “We feel very strongly that the secrecy in the family courts is leading to some outrageous injustices. It’s the big cartel courts and the legal profession and the social workers riding roughshod against ordinary people. We think common sense is needed to address this that means greater sensitivity and more openness in the family courts which this timely paper advocates.”,2015-10-27T15:23:00+0000,1283,165

Dyson’s vacuums  which use mainly “cyclonic” technology  are disproportionately penalised due to the flawed testing system which does not allow for fair comparison.  UKIP Small Business spokeswoman Margot Parker said  “I personally bought a Dyson last week but had I known this ECJ judgement was coming I would have bought two of them.   This judgement exposes the EU for the anti-competitive culture that it promotes. Bureaucrats hate entrepreneurs just as the EU detests democracy. Innovative British businesses are dicing with death when the EU gets them in a stranglehold.  “Unfortunately for Sir James Dyson he has found himself on the end of yet more anti-competitive  bureaucratic and ill-conceived European regulation.”,2015-11-11T20:04:01+0000,2675,557

The Public and Commercial Services Union is calling on the DVSA to conduct thorough research before making any changes  which seems a perfectly reasonable request. But in the meantime  the DVSA  the transport minister responsible  and the staff should all get round the table to resolve this for the benefit of all – the staff  and the general public who are sat on waiting lists.  “This whole situation has been badly mishandled.

Whereas by contrast the Government is looking at cutting some of the allowances whilst they are overseas.    There would be plenty of scope within the overseas aid budget to find that money times over and many people in this country would see that as a far greater priority. ,2015-11-27T09:53:52+0000,4732,1398

We will need to fight simultaneously in Nigeria  Kenya  Iraq  Syria  Libya and many other countries besides. And the West will have to swallow some pretty bitter pills.   I remember being denounced by Nick Clegg in our debates running up to the European Elections for saying that Putin was not our real enemy. That does not mean that I would invite Putin round for Sunday afternoon tea  but it does mean that on the battle against global jihadism we need to recognise that we’re on the same side. For many in Washington and London this is a difficult realisation. And dare one suggest that the same may even apply to Assad? However awful we may believe him to be.   In conclusion  I will back military action when I can see a proper plan with real co-ordination and the active involvement of ground troops from many affected countries.

Its is these groups  already at the bottom of the pile that are suffering from migration  and particularly uncontrolled low skilled migration from the European Union .

link,On a visit to Sutton  UKIP s London Mayoral candidate Peter Whittle announced that when the Mayor is responsible for making major planning decisions  UKIP will give Londoners the final say through binding referendums  if 5% of the local population petition for such a referendum within three months.  Peter Whittle said   One of my key priorities if elected Mayor is to actually give power back to those who it belongs to  the people. I want to put democracy back into the hands of local people when it comes to large and controversial developments.   Recent polling has shown in stark detail that Londoners increasingly feel powerless over their built environment. This is why UKIP s policy proposes binding referenda  held by local authorities  on any new large developments  if 5% of the local population petition for such a referendum within three months. This policy is a real transfer of power from the Mayor to the people and will help to protect the connection between Londoners and their city. ,2016-04-11T16:06:33+0000,1885,214

Rashford is only playing because of an injury crisis  but the problem with having so many EU players in the Premier League is that people like him usually wouldn’t be given a chance.  “The academies aren’t able to push players on to full-time contracts because they find it cheaper to recruit an established player from overseas.”,2016-04-17T15:04:38+0000,2407,380

UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem MEP:  The EU was supposed to be about corralling German military dominance in Europe. That aspiration has clearly died and just as Germany now politically dominates the EU  this latest move with the Dutch army shows that in time Germany wants to expand and control as much as it can militarily.   The EU is moving towards a common defence and foreign policy regime with an EU army as the goal.

This is simply unacceptable and will have a permanent detrimental effect on future generations of Londoners.   The only real way to protect the green belt is to make it illegal for local authorities to grant planning permission which leads to homes being built on it. The green belt is one of our nation s greatest national treasures and neither this nor future governments have the right to deprive be future generations of it. The answer is to make it impossible to build on green belt whilst incentivising brownfield and other non-contentious developments. ,2016-04-25T13:25:28+0000,1952,307

This report highlights a fundamental problem with the UK s migration policy in the EU  that only UKIP have been addressing. Some EU migrants make a net fiscal contribution  but this is offset by those who don t. Therefore the contribution made by some EU migrants is null and void. Whilst members of the EU  we do not have the ability to control the number of migrants coming into the UK  and until we do  we can not sufficiently plan and manage our future public services. ,2016-05-17T08:04:08+0000,2186,532

link,UKIP Leader Nigel Farage:  Open borders with Turkey would be a total disaster for our country. With a population of 80 million  it would mean even more uncontrolled migration into the UK and would include a huge flow of unemployed people into Britain. Then there is the security risk. For the UK to have total open borders with a country sharing a land border with Syria  Iraq and Iran would be madness.    Don’t let anyone tell you that open borders with Turkey can’t or won’t happen if we vote to Remain in the EU. A deal is already being done to give Turks visa-free access and we know that the likes of David Cameron and Angela Merkel have been long-time supporters of Turkey’s bid for full EU membership.   The alternative to all of this is that we vote to Leave  take back control of our democracy and take back control of our borders.

link,UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall MEP:  The truth is that the EU s Common Agricultural Policy - designed to prop up inefficient farmers on the continent - is the very reason why bills remain high in the UK. Research from both the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Business for Britain group have proved that to be the case.   In the UK  entirely because of EU policies  beef costs 35% more  turkey 22%  lamb 11%  wheat 15%  chicken 22%  and potatoes 10% - each one of those costs hitting every single family in Britain. On average a family in the UK would save £45 a month on their food bill if not for the wasteful EU policies that affect our food prices. ,2016-05-22T16:54:52+0000,3063,759

He just couldn t wait to display where his true loyalties lie. It is extraordinary.   Luckily there is an opportunity to make sure that the EU flag is never flown outside City Hall again and that is a Leave vote in the forthcoming EU Referendum.   It is also extraordinary that the English flag has not been flying from City Hall. London is the capital of England and we know full well that the Scottish and Welsh flags fly from their capital city s. So why not England?

link, There is already huge anxiety out there in the country regarding Theresa May s reluctance to trigger Article 50. Her rejection of the type of migration system so many went out there and voted Leave to see implemented indicates serious backsliding.   Those of us on the Leave side were perfectly clear in campaigning for strong border controls outside of the EU. The people were clear in wanting a points-based immigration system which is why so many went out and voted to Leave the European Union. Any watering down from that will lead to real anger.   If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences from a British public who on June 23rd voted for radical political change and now expect it to be delivered without failure.

Goodness knows the official opposition can’t: they don’t actually want to leave the EU  or cut immigration  or revive a school system which provided opportunity to all on the basis of merit  not money.

But it is clear that the Government remains hell-bent on throwing billions of pounds at HS2  when it would be much wiser to concentrate on improving our ageing nationwide infrastructure. The HS2 line will tear up large parts of our countryside  and wreck the lives of people in many rural communities. It will benefit only a small minority of travellers  yet all British taxpayers will have to foot the bill.”   I have yet to see a convincing economic case made for HS2  and the reason for this is that it simply doesn’t exist. Even before a track has been laid  this white elephant has cost nearly £1.5 billion. ,2016-10-12T14:24:26+0000,674,434

The report blasts the payments underlying the accounts as being  materially affected by error   leading the Court to issue an adverse opinion on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts. An adverse opinion is rare in accountancy  and is issued only in serious cases where there has been a substantial departure from generally accepted accounting principles.  Jonathan Arnott MEP:  It s a good thing that the British people voted to leave the European Union when we did because the levels of waste and bureaucracy are absolutely breath-taking. That s the nature of a system that simply isn t fit for purpose.   These examples of waste would make you think the EU is being run by  Count Von Count  from Sesame Street. Taxpayers  money is being wasted left  right and centre  the EU has obviously lost control of the money tap.

Hospital parking charges hit people when they are typically at their most stressed and anxious. Going to hospital as a patient or visitor is a stressful enough thing at the best of times. But when car parks are run as revenue maximising assets rather than as a facility for people it adds significantly to the stress.  “We in UKIP have for many years opposed hospital car parking charges as we regard them as little more than a tax on the sick and the vulnerable. In our general election manifesto we pledged to invest £200 million from savings made from tackling health tourism to make parking at English hospitals free for patients and their visitors. Given that Theresa May and the Conservative seem to be spending their time lifting policies from our manifesto can I suggest that they take a look at this one next.”,2016-10-14T10:54:46+0000,2090,470

Even with the knowledge of the chronic shortage of Social Housing  their current house building plans simply fail to address this situation. The programme s findings are no surprise to me or thousands of local residents. The chronic housing situation here is abysmal and is as a direct result of decades of failed policies from both Conservative and Labour Governments.   David Kurten AM  who speaks on housing for UKIP in the London Assembly added  “Successive governments and Mayors have all promised to build more homes  but have not delivered. The reality is that waiting lists for council homes will continue to increase until Britain gets immigration under control and brings down demand for new homes  so that the private rented sector returns to some kind of sanity  and everyday people can afford to rent homes normally.”,2016-10-19T14:33:10+0000,446,789

It’s been a case of too much talk  and not enough action.

To make them wait another year before this comes to Parliament is a complete dereliction of care towards all of those whose lives are being impacted.

Only when parts are incorporated into law by Act of Parliament does Parliament become involved  and the courts have jurisdiction over their application. Triggering Article 50 may indeed inevitably affect domestic law but until it does the courts have no jurisdiction.  “The Supreme Court meets on 7th December to confirm or set aside this decision.  If they confirm it they will be setting themselves against the democratic will of the electorate and will precipitate a constitutional crisis.

I have seen with my own eyes the devastating impact of uncontrolled unskilled immigration on our communities. UKIP is  was and will be in favour of immigration but it must be immigration on the UK’s terms.   Everyone in the world must feel there is a level playing field when it comes to coming to the UK. It doesn’t matter what your faith  ethnicity  nationality  gender  sexual orientation or any other aspect  what matters is what people can offer and what the country needs.   However  under Labour and latterly the Conservatives our immigration system has discriminated against the world  and especially the Commonwealth  to favour low skilled immigration from the European Union  this must end. ,2016-11-29T12:44:08+0000,1231,470

The result of the Referendum must be respected and enacted without delay.   Theresa May and her Tory Government cannot be trusted to deliver our withdrawal from the EU. She was a Remainer who heads a predominantly Remain government. Mrs May s strategy is to delay and delay the whole process in order to fudge it and to try and foist on us a  Norwegian or Swiss  type EU model whereby we continue to pay money to the EU  obey a large percentage of its laws  and have open borders. In which case we would not have left the European Union at all.   UKIP s policy will be to reject Article 50. Rather  we will call for Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act (1972) immediately as the first step in the process: this will restore law-making supremacy to the UK Parliament and put the British Government in the driving seat of negotiations not the EU. ,2016-11-29T16:05:53+0000,865,426

It is simple common sense that immigrants need many years to integrate into British society and culture.   Many of the report’s recommendations are things which UKIP has been saying for years. All schoolchildren should learn English  and have a proper understanding of British history and culture  whatever background they are from.   It is tolerance of certain different beliefs and practices which have led to turning a blind eye to FGM  child bride rapes and honour killings  not to mention challenging the lack of English language capability among specific groups such as Somali girls  and continued segregation in schools. These things should not be tolerated. Migrants must integrate into British culture and learn English properly.

If Tory MPs vote with Labour on this issue they will be putting themselves in opposition to the people. The Referendum result was very clear: the British people voted to leave the European Union. This was not dependent on any ‘deal’  and the voters’ decision was not conditional in any way.

The PM has made it clear that Article 50 will be triggered by March 2017. UKIP has no reason to believe that the number of EU migrants coming to the UK between the Referendum date (June 23rd 2016) and March 2017 will exceed historical averages  however UKIP reserves the right to review their right to stay here after we leave the EU because it s important that the UK government doesn t repeat the mistake made the German Chancellor  who gave the impression that  all  migrants were welcome to Germany & the EU. By creating a March 2017  sell by date  the government may unwittingly fuel unsustainable levels of EU migration to the UK.   Any EU national coming to the UK since the referendum result knew that the UK will be leaving  so their level of expectation is not the same as those who were here before the vote. EU citizens that come to the UK after Article 50 is triggered must understand that they cannot have any guarantees of a right to settle in the UK once we leave the EU. ,2016-12-12T15:15:59+0000,767,560

Hospital parking charges are a stealth tax on the sick and their carers  and UKIP agrees with the Patient Association: they are unfair and should be abolished.   In this day and age  it wouldn’t be difficult to ensure only those in need accessed free hospital parking to prevent misuse. If every other car park with a barrier in the country can manage it  using a token or other access system  then so can NHS trusts.

What is wrong with having a simple visa stamp in a passport to differentiate between those who have the right to live and work in the UK and those who don’t.  “It is time politicians woke up and realised the British public have little appetite for the introduction of an ID card  whether it be for EU nationals or the wider public.

Reintroduced gradually  as replacements  they are not a throwback to a nostalgic era  but a move to put us back in control of the production and specifications of our own pint.   “Across the whole range of manufacturing we have to look at returning to our own systems of British Standards as we unravel ourselves from EU red tape.”,2017-01-08T12:25:48+0000,1204,249

It is clear what the people of the UK voted for in June  and it is clear that she will do anything she can to delay and prevaricate on this simple instruction from the electorate. There is no purpose in delay  no purpose in leaving the air thick with claim and counter claim. This merely leaves Britain s people and businesses with nothing to work with and little to base their planning on. It is not good enough. Enough already. She she make it clear that if we do not get what we want  decent trading relations with our continental friends and a clear decision to return full control of immigration to Westminster  then she should simply repeal the European Communities Act. ,2017-01-08T16:03:01+0000,562,287

status,UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall MEP: Labour has betrayed millions of British families on immigration. It was Labour that threw open our jobs market to millions of Eastern Europeans with no transitional controls at all.   What Jeremy Corbyn is committing himself to today is not even worthy of the term  sticking plaster . For him to think stopping a few online job ads is going to have any real impact on the movement of people from the low wage economies of Eastern Europe is a joke.   The British people - and working class communities in particular - want full control restored over our borders so the volume of immigration can be brought down sharply.   That will ease the pressure on the NHS and other public services  on housing and community cohesion and give working people the prospect of a pay rise again after years of flatline wages. Only UKIP is offering this through our backing of a points system based on criteria that will slash migrant numbers.   If Jeremy Corbyn thinks working class voters will be fooled by the load of flannel he has come out with today then he has another thing coming. ,2017-01-10T07:24:35+0000,976,328

To claim to be making life better for the employed by making life worse for the self-employed is the worst kind of levelling down. It is an approach more befitting of big state socialism than of a party that claims to understand wealth creation.  “Self-employed people create their own jobs. They have no paid holidays  sickness benefits or company pension schemes and in fact no guaranteed income at all.  “They show guts and determination.

status,UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall writes   As you will know  Douglas Carswell has announced today that he is resigning from UKIP  to sit as an independent MP. He has said that he is doing this “cheerfully and amicably”.    This is not a surprise. I was elected on a pledge to forge unity in the party  and have had many discussions with key players to try and make that happen  but it had become increasingly clear to me that some things were simply beyond reach.   Douglas was genuinely committed to Brexit  but was never a comfortable Ukipper. On Monday  he had been due to meet with the National Executive Committee to answer various questions relating to longstanding issues  including published allegations that he had joined us in order to try to minimise Nigel Farage’s involvement in the Referendum.    Douglas’s defection to UKIP in 2014  along with Mark Reckless  and the two by-elections we fought successfully for them  proved that UKIP was capable of getting members elected to Parliament – albeit  it was still a tough task (as I know only too well  personally).   Our party has not benefited financially or organisationally from having Douglas in Westminster. With this in mind  his departure will make no difference to my ability or focus on delivering the reforms I promised when elected as Leader.   As we redefine our mission and take up the next phase of our campaign to rebuild a confident  independent nation  Douglas would have been increasingly out of kilter with our members’ aspirations.    We now have an opportunity to put behind us the most damaging internal conflict which has dogged us over the past year  and look forward with optimism and unity of purpose to the very real challenges of policing Brexit and further reforming the vigorous democracy of the UK. ,2017-03-25T14:07:47+0000,407,491

This is the fifth time Russia’s transport infrastructure has been attacked since 2007 - all of which have claimed serious loss of life.  “The fight against the terrorist is a global one and we must unite against this threat as well as uniting in grief. At the same time  we must also vow not to let our lives be dictated by the terrorist – the world will never submit to the terror of the bomb and the gun  no matter what. Good will always prevail over evil.”,2017-04-04T13:23:00+0000,374,122

status,Paul Nuttall  the UKIP leader has condemned the missile attack on Syria as   rash  trigger happy  nonsensical and will achieve nothing.    The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria  but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions  nor will it hasten peace in that country.   Too often rash responses to horrific situations are about the conscience of the attacker  rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation.   There are currently no good options in Syria. Assad or ISIS is not a choice anyone would wish to make. But firing off missiles in an enraged response shows weakness not strength in the face of horror.   I hoped for better from this administration. ,2017-04-07T08:53:00+0000,480,488

The establishment media used to make huge play of referring to IS as ‘the so called Islamic State’  but if Assad is forced to leave in the chaotic way that other leaders have been ousted  IS will soon have its own nation. Then we’ll be fighting them over here and the saddest thing is that it will be all our own fault. ,2017-04-11T08:41:36+0000,864,301

For Liz Truss to come up with a mission statement that leaves out both beggars belief and suggests she has had the wool pulled over her eyes by so-called  progressive  penal policy pressure groups.   By not specifically referencing  punishment  in the statement  it could allow governors further to soften regimes in prisons so that they become more like holiday camps rather than serious corrective institutions. ,2017-04-14T07:27:22+0000,330,373

link, I think the time has come to tell Turkey once and for all that she will not and never will join the European Union whilst Erdogan is at the helm. Then I believe we must then have a full and frank discussion as to whether Turkey should be allowed to remain a member of NATO. It needs to be made clear to President Erdogan that his actions have consequences. And he must be made to understand that if he continues to stamp out democracy and shift his country in the direction of resembling a Middle Eastern theocracy  then the gates the West will close  and close very rapidly indeed.

status,UKIP Leader Paul Nuttall:  We welcome the opportunity to take UKIP s positive message to the country.   However  we believe that the Prime Minister s decision to call this election is a cynical decision driven more by the weakness of Corbyn s Labour Party rather than the good of the country. There is also the prospect of a slew of Tory held by-elections caused by the seeming systematic breach of electoral law at the last election  predominantly in places where UKIP were pressing the Conservatives hard.   We are in the midst of Brexit negotiations so this election will provide a perfect opportunity for the 52% to vote for UKIP the only party wholeheartedly committed to a clean quick and efficient Brexit. ,2017-04-18T11:17:44+0000,1064,1249

Right now  the coddled elite are laughing at us  but that will change  and we will be proud to have lead this debate as we have lead others before.

Under their plans  we might as well not even bother. This is as near as you can get to staying in without remaining within the EU.  “Their fixation on going back and back to Parliament is merely cover for a desire to block Brexit and at best will hearten the EU to play the hardest ball possible during the next two years of negotiations.  “UKIP is the only party with a policy for leaving the EU quickly  cleanly and completely. Brexit must mean Exit.”,2017-04-25T11:31:31+0000,715,448

link,The Public Accounts Committee report on fraud in the International Aid budget was scathing about the dismissive attitude to fraud displayed by both the Foreign and International Development departments which suggested that there was no significant problem with fraud.  Lisa Duffy  UKIP s Foreign Aid spokesman said   As the Committee made clear  it isn t good enough to wave a hand and claim not to be able to divulge who is committing the fraud  it is imperative that people are able to know who is stealing their hard earned taxes.   That the Committee itself seems to accept that there are both  legal and cultural sensitivities  in divulging the identities of the fraudsters is equally worrying.   We have our own cultural sensitivity here in the UK  the one in which tax payers money is accounted for and accountable.   This report highlights one of the reasons why it is outrageous that the Government has committed itself to the .7% target of GDP to be spent on foreign aid. We should slash the budget keeping only humanitarian  disaster relief and clean water projects and repatriate the taxpayers money back to where it can help those taxpayers  here in the UK .,2017-04-26T13:46:36+0000,633,134

UKIP has long warned that the EU soft soap would start to take effect. We believe that if we handle the negotiations this way  by abandoning key aspects of legal and constitutional independence we will open ourselves up to even greater demands from the EU. Who hands over a strategic goal without a fight?   Why should our taxpayers  money be used to molly coddle the whims of the EU. British law or should I say England and Wales law with slight variations in Scotland should be our law not a soft option mixture with the EU. So here we start  does Brexit mean Brexit? Seemingly not. UKIP will fight and ensure that we are the guard dogs of Brexit. ,2017-04-27T10:29:17+0000,495,640
